code: raise TypeError


----
If previously it was hard to silent AgeRestrictedError without modifying enormous amount of source code of pytube lib,
    after these straightforward modifications you can catch a TypeError once AgeRestrictedError occurs.
        Simple Example:
            except TypeError:
                print(f"The video is 18+")
